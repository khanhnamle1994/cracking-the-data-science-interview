## Problem
Write a program to generate the partitions for a number n. A partition for n is a list of positive integers that sum up to n. For example: if n = 4, we want to return the following partitions: [1,1,1,1], [1,1,2], [2,2], [1,3], and [4]. Note that a partition [1,3] is the same as [3,1] so only the former is included.
