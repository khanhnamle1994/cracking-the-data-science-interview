## Problem
This problem was asked by Affirm.

Assume we have some credit model, which has accurately calibrated (up to some error) score of how credit-worthy any individual person is. For example, if the model’s estimate is 92% then we can assume the actual score is between 91 and 93. If we take 92 as a score cutoff and deem everyone above that score as credit-worthy, are we over-estimating or underestimating the actual population’s credit score?

## Solution
