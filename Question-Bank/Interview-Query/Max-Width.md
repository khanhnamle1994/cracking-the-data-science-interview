This question was asked by: Microsoft

Given an array of words and a maxWidth parameter, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

Example:

```
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16

Output =
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```
