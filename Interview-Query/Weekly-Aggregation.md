Given a list of timestamps in sequential order, return a list of lists grouped by week (7 days) using the first timestamp as the starting point.

**Example**:

ts = [
    '2019-01-01',

    '2019-01-08',
    '2019-02-01',
    '2019-02-02',
    '2019-02-05',
]

output = [
    ['2019-01-01', '2019-01-02'],
    ['2019-01-08'],
    ['2019-02-01', '2019-02-02'],
