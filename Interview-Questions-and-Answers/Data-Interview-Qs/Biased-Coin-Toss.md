## Question
Suppose you want to generate a sample of heads and tails from a fair coin. However, you only have a biased coin available (meaning the probability of coming up with heads is different than 1/2).

Write a simulation in python that will use your biased coin to generate a sample of heads/tails as if it were coming from a fair coin.
