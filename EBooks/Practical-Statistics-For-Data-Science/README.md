# Practical Statistics For Data Scientists

Code associated with the book "[Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962)"

The scripts are stored by chapter and replicate most of the figures and code snippets.

**HOW TO GET THE DATA**:
* Run R script:
* The data is not saved on github and you will need to download the data.
* You can do this in R using the sript `src/download_data.r`. This will copy the data into the data directory ~/statistics-for-data-scientists/data.

**Manual download**:
Alternatively, you can manually download the files from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B98qpkK5EJemYnJ1ajA1ZVJwMzg or from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/clb5aiswr7ar0ci/AABBNwTcTNey2ipoSw_kH5gra?dl=0

**IMPORTANT NOTE**:
The scripts all assume that you have cloned the repository into the top level home directory (~/). If you save the repository elsewhere, you will need to edit the line:
```
  PSDS_PATH <- file.path('~', 'statistics-for-data-scientists')
```
to point to the appropriate directory in all of the scripts.
